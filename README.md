# UPDATED SpaceRock - EXAM PROJECT
## ProOktatas Full-stack Develpoer bootcamp - JAVASCRIPT MODULE 

### **_Introduction_**
During the 4 months Javascript module, I have learned the basics and more of vanilla Javascript. In this exam project, there were some requirements. The project needed to be a CRUD app with a database connection. 

It needed an update as Tailwind Elements library and Tailwind Css itself had some conflict and because of that some of the feature is not working in the original project :( Then I realized if I need to rewrite most of the stuff, why not just rewrite as a Vue project. :) I also planning to try to use the concept of microservices. Lets dig in!

### **_Used Technologies_**
0. Vue
1. Tailwind Css and Tailwind library
2. Node Js / Express JS
3. MongoDB

## **_The project itself_**
The project idea is based on the ESA SACF https://sacf.esa.int/ . It is the European Space Agency Curator Facility and I am lucky to say I know some amazing people from there. I enjoyed to work on this project as it was a match with my geology degree.

**Aim of the Project**

To make a simple CRUD application where the user can add, modify and delete data (which is connected to a database). I also added pagination, a register and login site (using cookies) and a image uploading feature.
