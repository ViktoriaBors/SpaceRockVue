Problems:
- carousel working after refresh on the sample page, otherwise not working at all (no img or stops on current img)
- Missing to implement pagination, sampleCard and sampleCardForm (remember PROPS)

Remember!
After fetch data ref.value = data (not just ref)

Implementing modal
- background drop - not implemented yet

"Problems":
- dashboradNav -  emit so topNavbar disappears later
- search field - not working - problem on backend

Done:
- Home, Sample Type, Research Facility, Login - 100% working as I wanted

Missing:
- Database Center - missing backdrop when modal is open
                  - pagination
                  - search by name in backend fix
                  - pending or approved sample should be different color on Modal
- DashboardNav and TopNavBar fix (TopNavbar should disappear or at least the login menu option)
- DashboardView - check for session PROBLEM WITH RES.COOKIES - name can appear in dashboardNav
                                    - samples can be searched
                                    - search by name need fix here too
