Some parameters of the sample are\n          required (for example a name, short description and mineral composition).</li>\n        <li class=\"ml-5\">Meanwhile please send us a small amount of the sample for further characterization and research\n          in-house at SpaceRock.</li>\n        <li class=\"ml-5\">After all the in-house laboratory analysis checks out (and matches with your results), the\n          status of the sample changes from pending to approved.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p class=\"py-2\">These procedure ensure that the composition of the sample are well-described and follows all\n        standards.</p>\n      </div> \n      <div>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </main>\n  <BottomFooter/>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script setup>\nimport TopNavbar from '../components/TopNavbar.vue'\nimport Carousel from '../components/Carousel.vue'\nimport BottomFooter from '../components/BottomFooter.vue'\n\n</script>\n\n<style>\n\n</style>"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
